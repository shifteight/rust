Go ahead and type the program into a file; try to compile and fix all the bugs
with the help of the compiler. Try to fix one bug at a time and get feedback from
the compiler by recompiling the code. The point of this exercise, in addition to
covering the topics of this chapter, is to make you more comfortable with the
error messages from the compiler, which is an important mental exercise in
getting to know more about the compiler and how it analyzes your code. You
might also be surprised to see how the compiler is quite smart in helping you
removing errors from the code.
